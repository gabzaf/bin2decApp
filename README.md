<h1 align="left">Bin2Dec</h1>
<p>This is the first app I coded. The intention is to improve my coding skills.</p>
<p>Binary 2 Decimal allows the user to enter strings of up to 8 binary digits, 0's and 1's, in any sequence and then displays its decimal equivalent.</p>
<h2 align="left"> User Stories</h2>
<p>1. User can enter up to 8 binary digits in one input field;</p>
<p>2. User must be notified if anything other than a 0 or 1 was entered;</p>
<p>3. User views the results in a single output field containing the decimal (base 10) equivalent of the binary number that was entered.</p>
